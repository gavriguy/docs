# Extending Lyra

Extending Lyra has just become easier than ever. Starting from `v0.3.0`, Lyra exposes some of its internals:

```javascript
import {
  formatNanoseconds,
  getNanosecondsTime,
  intersectTokenScores,
  includes,
  boundedLevenshtein,
  tokenize
 } from '@lyrasearch/lyra/internals' 
```

Every exposed method comes with its own type definition.

Let's break them down:

### `formatNanoseconds`

Takes a `BigInt` as input and returns a human-readable `string`.

```javascript
import { formatNanoseconds } from '@lyrasearch/lyra/internals'

formatNanoseconds(30000n) // "30μs"
```

### `getNanosecondsTime`

Gets the current time with nanoseconds-precision. Returns a `BigInt`.

```javascript
import { getNanosecondsTime } from '@lyrasearch/lyra/internals'

getNanosecondsTime() // 1363500821581208n
```

### `intersectTokenScores`

Returns the intersection of `N` arrays.

```javascript
import { intersectTokenScores } from '@lyrasearch/lyra/internals'

intersectTokenScores([
  [
    ["foo", 1], ["bar", 1], ["baz", 2]
  ],
  [
    ["foo", 4], ["quick", 10], ["brown", 3], ["bar", 2]
  ],
  [
    ["fox", 12], ["foo", 4], ["jumps", 3], ["bar", 6]
  ]
])

// Result: [["foo", 9], ["bar", 9]]
```

### `includes`

faster alternative to `Array.prototype.includes`.

```javascript
import { includes } from '@lyrasearch/lyra/internals'

includes([10,20,30], 10) // true
```

### `boundedLevenshtein`

Computes the Levenshtein distance between two strings `(a, b)`, returning early with -1 if the distance is greater than the given tolerance. It assumes that `tolerance >= ||a| - |b|| >= 0`.

```javascript
import { boundedLevenshtein } from '@lyrasearch/lyra/internals'

boundedLevenshtein("moon", "lions", 3) // { isBounded: true, distance: 3 }
```
