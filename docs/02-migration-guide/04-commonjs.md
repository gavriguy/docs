# CommonJS Imports

Lyra now ships **ESM** modules by default. This allows us to move faster when providing new features and bug fixes, as well as using the `"exports"` field in `package.json` to provide a better developer experience.

CommonJS imports are still supported, but you'll need to import Lyra from `@lyrasearch/lyra/cjs` instead of `@lyrasearch/lyra`:

```diff
- const { search, insert, create } = require("@lyrasearch/lyra");
+ const { search, insert, create } = require("@lyrasearch/lyra/cjs");
```

No other changes are required.
