# Installation

Nebula is developed using **Node.js** and gets tested with **Bun**. So any of
these runtimes are sufficient for getting started.

You can install Nebula using the following command:

```bash title='Using npm'
npm i -g @lyrasearch/nebula
```

```bash title='Using yarn'
yarn add -g @lyrasearch/nebula
```

```bash title='Using pnpm'
pnpm add -g @lyrasearch/nebula
```

Once Nebula is installed, you can start writing a configuration file.
