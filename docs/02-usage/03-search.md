# Search

With the current version of Lyra, only type `string` properties are searchable, however, this does not prevent the addition of different types of properties. Lyra will keep them in memory and send the entire document back whenever there's a match for a query on searchable properties.

## Search

Let's say we have a database that contains some elements:

```javascript
import { create, insert, search } from "@lyrasearch/lyra";

const movieDB = await create({
  schema: {
    title: "string",
    director: "string",
    plot: "string",
    year: "number",
    isFavorite: "boolean",
  },
});

await insert(movieDB, {
  title: "The prestige",
  director: "Christopher Nolan",
  plot: "Two friends and fellow magicians become bitter enemies after a sudden tragedy. As they devote themselves to this rivalry, they make sacrifices that bring them fame but with terrible consequences.",
  year: 2006,
  isFavorite: true,
});

await insert(movieDB, {
  title: "Big Fish",
  director: "Tim Burton",
  plot: "Will Bloom returns home to care for his dying father, who had a penchant for telling unbelievable stories. After he passes away, Will tries to find out if his tales were really true.",
  year: 2004,
  isFavorite: true,
});

await insert(movieDB, {
  title: "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",
  director: "Chris Columbus",
  plot: "Harry Potter, an eleven-year-old orphan, discovers that he is a wizard and is invited to study at Hogwarts. Even as he escapes a dreary life and enters a world of magic, he finds trouble awaiting him.",
  year: 2001,
  isFavorite: false,
});
```

:::info
Notice that we are also importing the `search` method
:::

We can now search for one (or multiple) documents as easily as:

```javascript
const searchResult = await search(movieDB, {
  term: "Harry",
  properties: "*",
});
```

## Filters

The object that defines our query, in this case `{term: 'Harry', properties: '*'}`, can be shaped, by setting additional properties (filters), to **"tighten"** or **"loosen"** our query.

### Search term

The `term` property specifies the `word` to be searched.

```javascript
const searchResult = await search(movieDB, {
  term: "Chris",
});
```

We are now searching for all the documents that contain the word `Chris`.

### Search properties

The `properties` property defines in which property to run our query.

```javascript
const searchResult = await search(movieDB, {
  term: "Chris",
  properties: ["director"],
});
```

We are now searching for all the documents that contain the word `Chris` in the `director` property.

We can also search through nested properties:

```javascript
const searchResult = await search(movieDB, {
  term: "Chris",
  properties: ["cast.director"],
});
```

By default, Lyra searches in **all** searchable properties.

### Exact match

The `exact` property finds all the document with an exact match of the `term` property.

```javascript
const searchResult = search(movieDB, {
  term: "Chris",
  properties: ["director"],
  exact: true,
});
```

We are now searching for all the documents that contain **`exactly`** the word `Chris` in the `director` property.

> Without the `exact` property, for example, the term `Christopher Nolan` would be returned as well, as it contains the word `Chris`.

### Typo tolerance

The `tolerance` property allows specifying the maximum distance (following the Levenshtein algorithm) between the term and the searchable property.

> _The Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other._

```javascript
const searchResult = search(movieDB, {
  term: "Cris",
  properties: ["director"],
  tolerance: 1,
});
```

We are searching for all the documents that contain a term with an edit distance of `1` (e.g. `Chris`) in the `director` property.

:::warning
`Tolerance` doesn't work together with the `exact` parameter. `Exact` will have priority.
:::

### Results limits

The `limit` property limits the result at the specified number.

```javascript
const searchResult = search(movieDB, {
  term: "Chris",
  properties: ["director"],
  limit: 1,
});
```

We are searching for the `first` document that contains the term `Chris` in the `director` property.

### Results offset

The `offset` property skips the first `X` results.

```javascript
const searchResult = search(movieDB, {
  term: "Chris",
  properties: ["director"],
  offset: 1,
});
```

We are searching for all the documents that contains the term `Chris` in the `director` property, but returning the document at offset `1`.

:::info
By default, Lyra limits the search results to `10`, without any offset (so, `0` as offset value).
:::

## What does the `search` method return?[​](https://docs.lyrasearch.io/usage/search-data#what-does-the-search-method-return) <a href="#what-does-the-search-method-return" id="what-does-the-search-method-return"></a>

Now that we have learned how to perform **searches** on a Lyra database, we can briefly analyze the response that Lyra gives us back.

Let's say we have run the following query:

```javascript
const searchResult = search(movieDB, {
  term: "Cris",
  properties: ["director"],
  tolerance: 1,
});
```

Whether the document was found or not, Lyra gives back an `object` with the following properties:

```javascript
{
  elapsed: 181208n,
  count: 2,
  hits: [
    {
      id: '37149225-243',
      score: 0.23856062735983122,
      document: {
        title: "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",
        director: 'Chris Columbus',
        plot: 'Harry Potter, an eleven-year-old orphan, discovers that he is a wizard and is invited to study at Hogwarts. Even as he escapes a dreary life and enters a world of magic, he finds trouble awaiting him.',
        year: 2001,
        isFavorite: false
      }
    },
    {
      id: '37149225-5',
      score: 0.21267890323564321,
      document: {
        title: 'The prestige',
        director: 'Christopher Nolan',
        plot: 'Two friends and fellow magicians become bitter enemies after a sudden tragedy. As they devote themselves to this rivalry, they make sacrifices that bring them fame but with terrible consequences.',
        year: 2006,
        isFavorite: true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
