plugin system, leaving the core as small as possible. The Lyra core team is currently working on hooks, allowing the community to interact with the Lyra processes easily. That said, the Lyra core team is working on some official plugins to support specific features that might not be useful for the general public. That way, you will be able to bring in only the features you really need.

The stem need not be identical to the morphological root of the word; it is usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem, even if this stem is not in itself a valid root. Algorithms for stemming have been studied in computer science since the 1960s. Many search engines treat words with the same stem as synonyms as a kind of query expansion, a process called conflation.","type":"p"},{"pageRoute":"v0.3.1/text-analysis/stemming","sectionTitle":"Stemming","sectionContent":"By default, Lyra uses the English language analyzer, but we can override this behavior by setting the property defaultLanguage at database initialization.","type":"p"},{"pageRoute":"v0.3.1/text-analysis/stemming","sectionTitle":"Stemming","sectionContent":"import { create } from \"@lyrasearch/lyra\";import { stemmer } from \"@lyrasearch/lyra/dist/esm/stemmer/lib/it\";const db = create({  schema: {    author: \"string\",    quote: \"string\",  },  defaultLanguage: \"italian\",  tokenizer: {    stemmingFn: stemmer,  },});","type":"p"},{"pageRoute":"v0.3.1/text-analysis/stemming","sectionTitle":"Stemming","sectionContent":"Right now, Lyra supports 23 languages and stemmers out of the box: ArmenianArabicDanishSpanishEnglishFinnishFrenchGermanGreekHindiHungarianIndonesianItalianIrishDutchNepaliNorwegianPortugueseRomanianRussianSerbianSwedishTurkish","type":"p"},{"pageRoute":"v0.3.1/text-analysis/stemming","sectionTitle":"Stemming","sectionContent":"Disabling stemming","type":"h2"},{"pageRoute":"v0.3.1/text-analysis/stemming","sectionTitle":"Stemming","sectionContent":"‚Äã","type":"p"},{"pageRoute":"v0.3.1/text-analysis/stemming","sectionTitle":"Stemming","sectionContent":"You can disable stemming by setting enableStemming: false while initializing a new Lyra instance:","type":"p"},{"pageRoute":"v0.3.1/text-analysis/stemming","sectionTitle":"Stemming","sectionContent":"import { create } from \"@lyrasearch/lyra\";const db = create({  schema: {    author: \"string\",    quote: \"string\",  },  tokenizer: {    enableStemming: false,  },});","type":"p"},{"pageRoute":"v0.3.1/text-analysis/stemming","sectionTitle":"Stemming","sectionContent":"Edit this page","type":"p"},{"pageRoute":"v0.3.1/text-analysis/stemming","sectionTitle":"Stemming","sectionContent":"PreviousText Analysis NextStop-words","type":"p"},{"pageRoute":"v0.3.1/text-analysis/stemming","sectionTitle":"Stemming","sectionContent":"Disabling stemming","type":"p"},{"pageRoute":"v0.3.1/text-analysis/stemming","sectionTitle":"Stemming","sectionContent":"Copyright ¬© 2023 Lyra","type":"div"},{"pageRoute":"v0.3.1/text-analysis/stop-words","sectionTitle":"Stop Words","sectionContent":"Stop-words | Lyra‚ú®","type":"title"},{"pageRoute":"v0.3.1/text-analysis/stop-words","sectionTitle":"Stop Words","sectionContent":"Skip to main content","type":"p"},{"pageRoute":"v0.3.1/text-analysis/stop-words","sectionTitle":"Stop Words","sectionContent":"GitHub Slack","type":"p"},{"pageRoute":"v0.3.1/text-analysis/stop-words","sectionTitle":"Stop Words","sectionContent":"v0.3.1 v0.4.0v0.3.1","type":"p"},{"pageRoute":"v0.3.1/text-analysis/stop-words","sectionTitle":"Stop Words","sectionContent":"IntroductionUsagePluginsDeploymentText AnalysisStemmingStop-wordsInternals","type":"p"},{"pageRoute":"v0.3.1/text-analysis/stop-words","sectionTitle":"Stop Words","sectionContent":"This is documentation for  Lyra‚ú®  ","type":"div"},{"pageRoute":"v0.3.1/text-analysis/stop-words","sectionTitle":"Stop Words","sectionContent":"v0.3.1","type":"p"},{"pageRoute":"v0.3.1/text-analysis/stop-words","sectionTitle":"Stop Words","sectionContent":", which is no longer actively maintained.
