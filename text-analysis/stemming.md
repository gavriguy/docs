# Stemming

By default, Lyra analyzes the input and performs a `stemming` operation, which allows the engine to perform more optimized queries, as well as save indexing space.

> _In linguistic morphology and information retrieval, stemming is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base, or root form—generally a written word form. The stem need not be identical to the morphological root of the word; it is usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem, even if this stem is not in itself a valid root. Algorithms for stemming have been studied in computer science since the 1960s. Many search engines treat words with the same stem as synonyms as a kind of query expansion, a process called conflation._ [_Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming)__

By default, Lyra uses **the English language analyzer**, but we can override this behavior by setting the property `defaultLanguage` at database initialization.

```javascript
import { create } from "@lyrasearch/lyra";
import { stemmer } from "@lyrasearch/lyra/dist/esm/stemmer/lib/it";

const db = create({
  schema: {
    author: "string",
    quote: "string",
  },
  defaultLanguage: "italian",
  tokenizer: {
    stemmingFn: stemmer,
  },
});
```

If you're using CommonJS, you can import the correct stemming function by doing as follows:

```javascript
const { create } = require("@lyrasearch/lyra");
const { stemmer } = require("@lyrasearch/lyra/dist/cjs/stemmer/lib/it");

const db = create({
  schema: {
    author: "string",
    quote: "string",
  },
  defaultLanguage: "italian",
  tokenizer: {
    stemmingFn: stemmer,
  },
});
```

Right now, Lyra supports 23 languages and stemmers out of the box:

* Armenian
* Arabic
* Danish
* Spanish
* English
* Finnish
* French
* German
* Greek
* Hindi
* Hungarian
* Indonesian
* Italian
* Irish
* Dutch
* Nepali
* Norwegian
* Portuguese
* Romanian
* Russian
* Serbian
* Swedish
* Turkish

## Disabling stemming

You can disable stemming by setting `enableStemming: false` while initializing a new Lyra instance:

```javascript
import { create } from "@lyrasearch/lyra";

const db = create({
  schema: {
    author: "string",
    quote: "string",
  },
  tokenizer: {
    enableStemming: false,
  },
});
```
